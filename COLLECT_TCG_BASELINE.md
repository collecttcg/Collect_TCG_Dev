Current Development behavior:

- The existing eBay Ban List remains Owner-only and Supabase/RLS protected; its old route redirects into `Inventory Tools > eBay > eBay Ban List`.
- Existing Listed on eBay status, optional eBay URL, public On eBay badge and Owner `On eBay only` inventory filter remain retained.
- MYR below RM400 continues current-rate USD/SGD conversion rounded to the nearest whole amount; RM400+ retains the established upward pricing rule.
- Development SEO refresh remains release-agnostic, was regenerated/validated for this release, and retains `noindex,nofollow,noarchive`.
- Owner-only AI Card Scanner, QR Generator, generators, private analytics and established Owner Inventory Tools remain retained.

### Production 2026-11-03-v01
Purpose: consolidate Owner eBay tools under Inventory Tools > eBay, add a separate After Shipped feedback message, and refresh Production SEO output.

Current Production behavior:
- Owner Inventory Tools now exposes a dedicated `eBay` category with `eBay Messages`, `eBay Ban List`, and `eBay Listing Status`.
- eBay Messages contains separate After Purchase and After Shipped copyable templates; After Shipped asks satisfied buyers for positive store feedback.
- eBay Ban List remains Owner-only and protected by existing Supabase RLS; the former standalone route redirects into the consolidated eBay tools area.
- Existing eBay listing-status controls and public On eBay behavior are retained.
- Production-specific QR Generator, scanner endpoint, analytics/privacy boundaries, generators, Contact to Buy, giveaways and stable public URLs remain retained.
- Production SEO was regenerated and validated with index/follow card metadata, sitemap/robots checks and UUID exclusion.
- Below RM400 FX whole-number conversion and RM400+ upward pricing behavior remain unchanged.
- SQL/database/RLS/Edge Function change required by v01: No.

Production v01 validation completed:
- rollback anchor validated;
- all Production JavaScript syntax checks passed;
- Production/retained and consolidated eBay tools contracts passed;
- SEO workflow guard, SEO self-test, regeneration and output validation passed;
- full/patch ZIPs created and integrity-checked;
- immutable `2026-11-03-v01` manifest/checksums recorded;
- GitHub Pages deployment for the release manifest commit completed successfully;
- `production-last-known-good` advanced to `c907d0c685ef0e0b6f3b36d82dc997855c44c0ba` after Pages success.

Production validation limitations:
- Live Production was not manually opened to avoid contaminating Insights.
- Interactive desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing was not performed.

## Historical immutable state retained
- Production `2026-11-02-v03` / Development `2026-11-02-v03` remain immutable and introduced whole-number current-rate FX conversion below RM400.
- Production `2026-11-02-v02` / Development `2026-11-02-v02` remain immutable and introduced normal current-rate FX conversion below RM400 with two-decimal output before v03 changed that low-price output to whole numbers.
- Production `2026-11-02-v01` remains immutable and contains the validated eBay import-duty refusal notice and Buyer Message `Collect TCG` signature promotion.
- Development `2026-11-02-v01` remains immutable as an earlier Development release.
- Production `2026-11-01-v03` remains immutable and contains the release-agnostic SEO/release infrastructure update.
- Production `2026-11-01-v02` remains immutable and contains earlier Buyer Messages/eBay generator messaging promotion.
- Production `2026-11-01-v01` / Development `2026-11-01-v01` remain immutable prior releases containing eBay listing-status and quick-action viewport preservation.
- Production `2026-10-31-v02` / Development `2026-10-31-v02` remain immutable prior releases containing Inventory sorting and responsive toolbar improvements.
- Production `2026-10-31-v01` / Development `2026-10-31-v01` remain immutable prior releases containing Owner image workflow and PSA POP improvements.
- Production `2026-10-30-v04` / Development `2026-10-30-v06` remain immutable prior releases and retain the modern HEIC decoder path.
- Production `2026-10-25-v03` added the Owner eBay Ban List and `migrations/2026/2026-10-25-v03-EBAY-BANLIST.sql`, applied and verified on Supabase project `cbzytysxtdcqxuckspye`.

## Canonical retained behavior
Preserve public card pages/SEO/stable URLs/SPA history; Related Cards/Trending/discovery attribution; Inventory/Collection/Sold/Reserved/Favorites; Inventory sorting and custom ordering; Owner Mode and Owner-only tools; JPEG/PNG/WebP/HEIC/HEIF listing photos; compact Owner Inventory Tools; Owner categories/Unassigned Owners; inventory value; eBay Messages; private analytics/Buyer Preview; Owner-only AI Card Scanner; eBay Ban List and listing status; QR Generator; Post Generators/giveaways; Contact to Buy; Malaysia/Singapore messaging; Supabase/RLS and analytics boundaries; Safari-safe layout; Development analytics-test exclusion in Development only.

## Intentionally removed / excluded
Do not restore Download Share Preview; V200 inquiry basket; V201 custom Share menu/grid; V202 share-menu experiment; V203/V204 compact-layout experiments; abandoned/superseded scanner/layout experiments; old Beta runtime dependencies; Development-only analytics-test behavior in Production; post-v09 duplicate Inventory Manager/dashboard renderer.

## SQL / database baseline
- Latest relevant Production migration remains `migrations/2026/2026-10-25-v03-EBAY-BANLIST.sql`.
- `public.ebay_banlist` remains Owner-only through RLS.
- Card Owner assignment uses existing private `card_owner_private` metadata and authorization.
- Production `2026-11-03-v01` required no SQL/database/RLS/Edge Function change.

## Release contract
A release is complete only after applicable implementation, validation, regression review, committed-file inspection, package integrity checks, immutable manifest, Pages deployment and rollback protection are confirmed. **Tested** means executed; **Statically verified** means repository/code inspection only; **Not tested** means unavailable/not performed. Do not live-open Production for routine testing without explicit authorization.

## Baseline maintenance
Reconcile this file in both Development and Production repositories after every accepted release or meaningful state change. Preserve historical release facts and retained/removed behavior; never rewrite immutable manifests from assumptions.
