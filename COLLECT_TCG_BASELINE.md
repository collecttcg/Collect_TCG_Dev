# Collect TCG Current Baseline

Last reconciled against GitHub: 2026-10-05

## Repositories

- Production: `collecttcg/Collect_TCG`
- Development: `collecttcg/Collect_TCG_Dev`
- Default branch: `main`

Development is the working environment. Production is protected and must not be changed, promoted, deployed, or prepared unless explicitly requested.

Repository inspection and the latest release manifests take precedence over this document if an external change occurs after reconciliation.

---

## Versioning Transition

`V210` is the final legacy `V###` release. Do not rename legacy releases.

All later releases use:

`YYYY-MM-DD-vNN`

Use the actual build date. Development and Production have independent counters and restart at `v01` on each date.

---

## Repository rename transition

- Active environment terminology changes from **Beta** to **Development/Dev** starting with `2026-09-27-v05`.
- Repository target name: `collecttcg/Collect_TCG_Dev`.
- Historical Beta release names, manifests, package names and references remain unchanged.
- The legacy internal `beta/` directory was retained through v07 for migration safety and is renamed to canonical `dev/` in Development `2026-09-27-v08`.
- Future Development packages use `Collect-TCG-Dev-...`.
- Production `2026-09-27-v05` removed the final runtime dependency on the old Beta repository by localizing the Zatch Bell logo.

Production package-validation HEAD: `a30f219a57623bb4cdead48f2370910c2018659f`

GitHub Pages status at reconciliation:
- Development `2026-09-27-v08` renames the active application directory to `dev/` and publishes the contents of `dev/` as the GitHub Pages root, so public Development URLs no longer expose `/beta/` or `/dev/`.
- Production remains unchanged and protected.

Important promotion state:
- Production `2026-09-27-v06` reconciled active terminology with the renamed Development repository; no Development application behavior was promoted.
- Production `2026-09-29-v07` promoted validated Development `2026-09-29-v11`, including the v09 repository refactor and v10 Game-first Post Generator titles.
- Production last-known-good: `56336f79bd1d94ef79238a70280528f15c66302b`.
- Production 2026-09-27-v04 completed the last-known-good recovery automation; it does not promote new Beta application behavior.
- `production-last-known-good` now advances only after the final Production manifest commit successfully deploys through GitHub Pages.
- Current validated/deployed Production last-known-good commit: `56336f79bd1d94ef79238a70280528f15c66302b`.
- External disaster-recovery repository: `collecttcg/Collect_TCG_Backup` (private; created 2026-10-01). Git repository recovery is automated weekly/on-demand using full Git bundles for Production and Development. Workflow run `36885168071` successfully bundle-verified and round-trip restored both repositories with full ref comparison; snapshot release `repository-backup-2026-10-01T153324Z`. Supabase database + actual Storage object recovery remains pending and must not be treated as validated.
- Production 2026-09-27-v02 promoted filtered rearranging from Beta 2026-09-27-v02.
- Filtered Inventory/Collection card rearranging is therefore now shared by Beta and Production; hidden cards retain their global slots and filtered views do not rewrite game-category order.
- Production 2026-09-27-v01 retains the validated Beta v16 functional baseline and adds Production-only repository cleanup plus QR Generator registration repair.
- Beta v18 new-card custom-order insertion behavior is **not yet promoted to Production**.
- Beta v19 Beta-repository cleanup/migration reorganization is not an application-code promotion.
- Beta v20 baseline/documentation reconciliation was not an application-code promotion.
- Beta 2026-09-27-v01 is a documentation-only baseline sync after the Production cleanup.

## Current Release State

### Development `2026-10-05-v01`

Previous Development: `2026-09-30-v03`

Purpose: preserve country attribution for Qualified Views when embedded browsers use a different anonymous visitor ID for the card-view request than the earlier site-visit request.

Changes:
- Development Qualified Views call the Development-only `record-card-view-dev` Edge Function.
- The function records the existing legacy card view and returns the request country without storing visitor IP addresses.
- `qualified_card_view_events.country_code` stores that request country when available.
- Owner Market Demand prefers the Qualified View country, then falls back to the historical visitor-ID country join for older rows.
- Existing Production `record-card-view` is unchanged.
- The client retains backward-compatible fallbacks if the Development-only function or migration is unavailable.

SQL required: Yes — `migrations/2026/2026-10-05-v01-QUALIFIED-VIEW-COUNTRY.sql`.
SQL status: applied to the connected Collect TCG Supabase project on 2026-10-05.
Edge Function status: Development-only `record-card-view-dev` version 1 deployed successfully.

Release records:
- Implementation commit: `d7e6002558b0a465d44613541ebbda06480f0de8`

Validation status: completed successfully. The final feature regression suite passed (65/65). SEO syntax/self-test/generation, repository-wide JavaScript/import/reference validation, CSS and retained release contracts, Development package creation/integrity, artifact upload and GitHub Pages deployment all passed. The Supabase migration was applied and the Development-only `record-card-view-dev` Edge Function version 1 was deployed successfully.

Validation limitation: interactive desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing was not performed; the country-attribution path was validated through repository regression/static checks plus confirmed Supabase migration/function deployment. No synthetic buyer analytics event was inserted for testing.

### Development `2026-09-30-v03`

Previous Development: `2026-09-30-v02`

Purpose: restore explicit Raw card condition visibility in the Card Information section on both desktop and mobile card details.

Changes:
- Adds a `Condition` item immediately after `Format` when the effective card format is Raw.
- Uses the existing full condition label already calculated by card details (for example Near Mint or Damaged).
- The shared details markup means the same field appears on desktop and mobile.
- Graded cards do not receive a redundant Condition item; their grade remains in the existing Grade / Condition summary.
- No CSS/layout redesign and no database changes.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. The final feature regression suite passed (64/64), including the Raw-condition Card Information contract. Changed JavaScript syntax/import/reference validation, CSS and retained release contracts, SEO syntax/self-test/generation, package creation/integrity, artifact upload and Development GitHub Pages deployment all passed. Static inspection confirms desktop and mobile use the same Card Information markup, so the Raw Condition field is present in both layouts without a CSS-specific branch.

Release records:
- Implementation commit: `58f2318cef1c206a9a3afd67ae15fa8d8768a4cf`

Validation limitation: interactive desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing was not performed; desktop/mobile coverage for this field is statically verified from their shared renderer rather than visually exercised in a browser.

### Development `2026-09-30-v02`

Previous Development: `2026-09-30-v01`

Purpose: make `WTS` the first text in the Generate Post Details WTS title while preserving the approved game/format/era/detail order.

Changes:
- Changes the single-card Generate Post Details title from `[GAME] WTS【FORMAT】【ERA】 ...` to `WTS [GAME]【FORMAT】【ERA】 ...`.
- Example: `WTS ONE PIECE HYPER BATTLE【DMG】【VINTAGE】 2001 CARDDASS GRAND BOX DX ACE C531`.
- Does not change Card List, Card Drop, NFS, eBay, Carousell or Giveaway title formats.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. The full feature regression suite passed (63/63), including the exact WTS-first Ace C531 title regression. SEO syntax/self-test/generation, repository-wide JavaScript/import/reference validation, CSS and retained release contracts, package creation/integrity, artifact upload and Development GitHub Pages deployment all passed.

Validation limitation: interactive desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing was not performed.

### Development `2026-09-30-v01`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v14`

Purpose: move the existing primary **Prepare eBay Listing** action to the top of the eBay Listing output section for consistency and visibility.

Changes:
- Moves the existing `Prepare eBay Listing` button directly below the eBay Listing section heading and above the eBay Title field.
- Keeps the one-step prepare behavior unchanged: copy Title + Item Specifics + Description, then create/download the existing image ZIP when images are available.
- Retains Copy Title, Copy Item Specifics, Copy Description, Copy All, Download Images (.ZIP) and Open Card.
- No changes to generated eBay text, card selection, Owner permissions, Facebook/Carousell generators, inventory, analytics, Contact to Buy, giveaways or Supabase/RLS.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. Feature regression tests (62/62), SEO syntax/self-test/generation, repository-wide JavaScript/import/reference validation, CSS and retained release contracts, the dedicated eBay button-placement regression, package creation/integrity, artifact upload and Development GitHub Pages deployment all passed.

Validation limitation: interactive desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing was not performed.

### Development `2026-09-29-v14`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v13`

Purpose: add a one-step **Prepare eBay Listing** action for consistency with the Facebook and Carousell Post Generators.

Changes:
- Adds a primary `Prepare eBay Listing` button to the Owner eBay Listing Generator.
- The action copies the same combined Title + Item Specifics + Description payload as `Copy All`.
- When the selected card has images, the action also creates/downloads the existing eBay image ZIP and reports included/skipped image results.
- When no images are available, preparation still succeeds as a copy-only action.
- Existing Copy Title, Copy Item Specifics, Copy Description, Copy All, Download Images (.ZIP) and Open Card actions are retained.
- No changes to eBay listing text generation, Facebook/Carousell output, inventory data, Owner permissions, analytics, Contact to Buy, giveaways or Supabase/RLS.

SQL required: No.

Implementation commit: `a961041eb29c82a7f3b0b2c5ccf681a137800813`

Validation status: implementation committed; validation and packaging in progress.

Validation limitation: interactive desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing has not been performed.

### Development `2026-09-29-v13`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v12`

Purpose: make the Owner quick-card **Mark Sold** action deterministically set Availability to Sold and stamp the sale date/time at the moment the owner clicks Mark Sold.

Changes:
- Quick **Mark Sold** now sends `availability: Sold` together with a fresh `sold_at` timestamp created at the click action.
- The Sold archive therefore displays the local calendar date corresponding to the Mark Sold click instead of depending on the database trigger to create the timestamp.
- Moving a sold card back to Available, Reserved or Collection (NFS) continues to clear the local `sold_at` value and preserves the existing database-trigger fallback.
- No changes to manual Add/Edit sold-date controls, Bulk Status behavior, buyer-interest snapshot capture, Owner permissions, public visibility, analytics, Contact to Buy, generators or giveaways.

SQL required: No. The existing `sold_at` field is reused.

Validation status: completed successfully. The new executable regression confirmed that quick Mark Sold stamps a fresh timestamp during the click action and that moving the listing out of Sold clears the local sold-date value. The complete 60/60 feature regression suite, SEO generator syntax/self-test and generation, repository-wide JavaScript/import/reference validation, CSS and retained release contracts, package creation, ZIP integrity checks and Development Pages deployment all passed.

### Development `2026-09-29-v12`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v11`

Purpose: restore the Card List Post Generator title/header order from before the v10 Game-first expansion, without reverting Game-first behavior in Card Drop or any other generator.

Changes:
- Card List first line returns to the localized Card List heading and update date without a Game prefix.
- Card List WTS title line again places the selected Game label immediately before `WTS【CARD LIST】`, matching the pre-v10 Card List format.
- Card Drop remains Game-first.
- Single Card WTS/NFS, listing title, eBay, Carousell and giveaway behavior are unchanged.
- Refreshed only the affected Post Generator/cache and validation contracts.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. The v12 regression test confirmed Card List restored its pre-v10 heading/title order while Card Drop remains Game-first. The complete feature regression suite, SEO generator syntax/self-test and generation, repository-wide JavaScript/import/reference validation, CSS and retained release contracts, package creation, ZIP integrity checks and Development Pages deployment all passed.

Release records:
- Core implementation commit: `b73b770372981426ecfc33f4406c5e4cd17c94a7`

Validation limitation: interactive desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing was not performed. Static/executable validation and Development Pages deployment completed successfully.

### Development `2026-09-29-v11`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v10`

Purpose: update the inventory image watermark CTA wording without changing the approved watermark layout, QR destination, logo, URL treatment or responsive sizing.

Changes:
- Rendered watermark CTA changes from the baked artwork wording “CHECK PRICE • AVAILABILITY” to “CHECK FULL INVENTORY”.
- The approved 1113×242 banner remains the canonical artwork; only its CTA text band is replaced during canvas rendering.
- Logo, tagline, URL treatment, QR frame/decorations, dynamically regenerated QR interior, banner dimensions and responsive placement are preserved.
- Applies to both Logo + CTA + QR and CTA + QR-only watermark paths because both use the same website watermark renderer.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. Final GitHub validation passed 58/58 feature/regression tests including the watermark CTA contract, SEO generator syntax/self-test and generation, repository-wide JavaScript syntax/import/reference checks across 62 JavaScript files, CSS validation, retained release contracts, package creation and ZIP integrity checks. Development Pages deployment completed successfully. Earlier intermediate validation runs stopped on stale v10/v08 validation metadata/cache markers; those guards were reconciled and the final complete workflow passed.

Release records:
- Validated source/generated commit: `7a84e42cd702dd0a6a5a83c2d6aed5ee4de457f8`

### Development `2026-09-29-v10`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v09`

Purpose: make generated Post Generator titles start with the Game category whenever game data is available.

Changes:
- Single Card Facebook WTS and NFS titles place the normalized Game label first.
- Single Card copy/listing titles and eBay listing titles place Game first.
- Carousell inventory-card generated Product Details start with Game before the format/card lead line.
- Card List and Card Drop generated posts start their first/title line with the selected card game category; mixed-game selections list their unique game labels first.
- Giveaway headings remain unchanged because giveaway records do not provide a Game field; no game is inferred from prize text.
- Added regression coverage for the Game-first title contract across applicable Post Generators and refreshed affected module cache-busters.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. Final GitHub validation passed 57/57 feature/regression tests, SEO generator syntax/self-test and generation, repository-wide JavaScript syntax/import/reference checks, CSS validation, retained release contracts, package creation and ZIP integrity checks. The final package-validation commit deployed successfully through GitHub Pages. Earlier intermediate runs failed/cancelled while the requested scope was expanded and a new test fixture was corrected; the final complete workflow passed.

Release records:
- Validated source commit: `731309070841312640101f2e6f0ef427eef1d207`

### Development `2026-09-29-v09`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v08`

Purpose: repository-wide legacy refactor with behavior preservation and explicit rollback protection.

Changes:
- Created rollback branch `rollback/pre-refactor-2026-09-29-v08` at pre-refactor HEAD `99152be1fdca641d671f62b300c230a7fdc78db0`.
- Consolidated global CSS layers into canonical `01-foundation.css` + `02-components.css` while preserving cascade order; removed two parser-invalid inert escaped-newline legacy blocks and selector families with no active source references.
- Split Post Generator giveaway, marketplace/eBay/Carousell, and Card List/Card Drop logic into focused modules behind the same appContext contract.
- Split Inventory page shell/options from the interaction controller.
- Added a shared Insights extension lifecycle so enhancements no longer replace the same appContext methods in an implicit wrapper chain.
- Removed the superseded analytics contact-intent scoring implementation; `contact-intent-policy.js` remains the single scoring source of truth.
- Removed confirmed unreferenced runtime state/globals.
- Feature modules are now imported once through `register-features.js`; `initialize.js` is a compatibility facade, eliminating duplicate module evaluation caused by mismatched query URLs.
- Consolidated historical workflow assertions into `tools/release-contracts.sh` and added `tools/check-css.mjs`.
- Reconciled Development baseline/checker with Production `2026-09-29-v05`.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. The final GitHub validation run passed 56/56 feature/regression tests, repository-wide JavaScript syntax/import/HTML asset/migration checks, CSS syntax and obsolete-selector guards, the complete retained release-contract chain, SEO generation/self-test, package creation, ZIP integrity checks and Development GitHub Pages deployment. The first post-refactor validation run correctly failed because the superseded pre-consolidation CSS files were still present; those consolidated legacy files were removed and the full validation workflow was rerun successfully.

Release records:
- Pre-refactor rollback branch: `rollback/pre-refactor-2026-09-29-v08` -> `99152be1fdca641d671f62b300c230a7fdc78db0`

### Development `2026-09-29-v08`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v07`

Purpose: normalize Post Generator hashtags to lowercase without changing post body/title text.

Changes:
- All hashtag fields are normalized to lowercase before generated post output.
- Existing legacy `#TCGCollector` defaults are now `#tcgcollector`.
- Saved/custom hashtags are also lowercased, so manually entered uppercase hashtag characters cannot leak into generated posts.
- Applies to single-card WTS/NFS posts, Giveaway posts, and Card List/Card Drop posts.
- No post title, description, language, sales footer, Contact to Buy, inventory, Owner Mode, giveaway entry logic, analytics or Supabase behavior is otherwise changed.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. The Development workflow ran repository-wide JavaScript syntax/import/asset checks, retained regression checks, and a dedicated lowercase hashtag test covering the legacy default plus mixed-case custom inputs. Full and patch ZIPs were created and integrity-checked, the package manifest was committed, and the final Development GitHub Pages deployment completed successfully.

### Development `2026-09-29-v07`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v06`

Purpose: make the website QR/CTA watermark sizing smoothly responsive to image aspect ratio instead of switching abruptly at the landscape boundary.

Changes:
- Square and portrait images retain the existing 82% image-width target.
- Landscape images now shrink progressively from 82% at 1:1 to 62% at 5:4 (1.25:1).
- Images at 5:4, 4:3, 16:9 and wider retain the 62% minimum width target, with the existing 24% image-height cap still acting as a second safeguard.
- Representative 1080-wide results: 1:1 ≈ 886×193 px; ~1.10:1 ≈ 798×174 px; 1.20:1 ≈ 713×155 px; 4:3 ≈ 670×146 px; 16:9 ≈ 670×146 px; portrait ≈ 886×193 px.
- The approved banner artwork, QR replacement coordinates, bottom placement and source image remain unchanged.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. The full retained Development regression chain passed, including v05 and v06 watermark guarantees. Dedicated v07 executable validation passed portrait, square, slight-landscape (~1.10:1), medium-landscape (1.20:1), 4:3 and wide-landscape cases and explicitly verified progressive sizing between intermediate aspect ratios. Changed JavaScript syntax, repository/import/asset checks, generated SEO, package creation, ZIP integrity/hash verification and Development Pages deployment all passed.

### Development `2026-09-29-v06`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v05`

Purpose: correct the remaining oversized website QR/CTA watermark on ordinary 4:3 landscape photos while preserving the v05 wide-landscape fix and portrait sizing.

Changes:
- True landscape photos (`width > height`) now use a 62% image-width target in addition to the existing 24% image-height cap.
- The supplied 1080×810 4:3 photo now computes at about 670×146 px instead of about 886×193 px.
- The earlier 1080×607 wide-landscape case remains about 670×146 px.
- Square and portrait images retain the existing 82% width behavior (1080-wide representative cases remain about 886×193 px).
- The approved banner artwork, QR replacement coordinates, bottom placement and source photo remain unchanged.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. The full retained Development regression chain passed, including the v05 wide-landscape guarantee. Dedicated v06 executable sizing validation passed for the supplied 1080×810 4:3 landscape case, the earlier 1080×607 wide-landscape case, a 1080×1080 square case and a 1080×1512 portrait case. Changed JavaScript syntax, repository/import/asset validation, generated SEO, package creation/integrity and the Development Pages deploy job all passed. Downloaded release ZIPs passed independent `unzip -t` integrity checks and SHA-256 matched the manifest.

Validation limitation: interactive desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing was not performed. Watermark sizing was executable/static validated; user visual confirmation on Development remains appropriate.

### Development `2026-09-29-v05`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v04`

Purpose: keep the approved Collect TCG website QR/CTA watermark from appearing disproportionately large on horizontal/landscape photos.

Changes:
- The website watermark keeps the existing 82% width target for portrait/card images.
- Banner width is additionally capped so the banner height is at most 24% of the source image height before normal margins.
- For the supplied 1080×607 landscape example, the computed banner changes from about 886×193 px to about 670×146 px.
- Landscape photos therefore receive a smaller banner while the approved banner artwork, QR replacement coordinates, bottom placement and portrait behavior remain unchanged.
- No uploaded source image is cropped or resized differently by this change.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. Feature tests passed 55/55, changed JavaScript syntax passed, repository/import/asset validation passed after aligning two stale Production-baseline checker markers, and the full retained Development regression chain passed. Dedicated v05 executable sizing validation confirmed the supplied 1080×607 landscape case is reduced, remains within the 24% height cap, and a representative portrait image retains the previous 82% width sizing. Generated SEO, release packaging and Development Pages deployment passed. Downloaded release ZIPs passed independent `unzip -t` integrity checks and SHA-256 matched the manifest.

### Development `2026-09-29-v04`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v03`

Purpose: fix owner-only route restoration comprehensively after browser refresh/new-tab startup, covering Post Generator Tools, Insights and the other owner-only routes.

Changes:
- `applyOwnerMode()` no longer changes routes; the central router is now the single fail-closed authority for owner-only route access.
- Startup restores the normal persisted Supabase browser session before attempting the optional Post Generator cross-tab handoff.
- Owner verification distinguishes a conclusive non-owner result from a transient RPC/auth error and retries a transient verification once after a server-confirmed `getUser()`/session refresh path.
- Owner card loading retries once after re-resolving the authenticated session before falling back to the existing public catalogue safety path.
- Browser auth persistence/auto-refresh/localStorage use is explicit in the Supabase client configuration rather than relying only on SDK defaults.
- Both catalogue registration and catalogue initialization cache references advance to v04, preventing a stale initializer module during refresh.
- The existing final router still redirects unauthenticated/non-owner users away from Insights, Post Generator Tools and every other owner-only route.
- Existing FB/Carousell/eBay separate-tab behavior and selected-card preselection are retained.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. Local validation passed 52/52 feature tests, including executable transient-owner-retry and conclusive-non-owner fail-closed tests, plus syntax checks for every changed JavaScript file and the repository/import/asset checker. The first two GitHub attempts correctly stopped on stale cache assertions; those validation regressions were fixed. Final workflow run `36446412109` passed the full retained regression chain, the dedicated v04 owner-route restoration check, generated SEO, release packaging and Development Pages deployment. Package-validation Pages run `36446473511` completed successfully. Both release ZIPs were downloaded, independently integrity-tested with `unzip -t`, and their SHA-256 hashes matched the manifest.

Validation limitation: interactive authenticated desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing was not available. The reported browser symptom is addressed by the corrected startup/auth/cache path and executable auth tests, but user confirmation in Development is still required for the actual browser refresh/new-tab behavior.

### Development `2026-09-29-v03`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v02`

Purpose: fix the browser startup race where a newly opened owner Post Generator tab could briefly show `fb-tools` and then be redirected to Inventory before Owner authentication finished resolving.

Changes:
- Owner UI application can temporarily defer only the owner-route redirect while a requested Post Generator handoff is being resolved.
- The fallback persisted-session lookup receives the same temporary defer flag when the new-tab handoff was requested.
- Successful handoff applies Owner state without prematurely redirecting, removes the handoff nonce, and then startup reaches the existing central router gate.
- The central router remains fail-closed: after authentication resolution, non-owner/public sessions are still redirected away from `fb-tools`.
- FB, Carousell and eBay new-tab behavior and selected-card preselection from v02 are retained.
- No public Owner controls or data are exposed by the defer window; owner-only content is not rendered until startup reaches the final router.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. Local validation passed 53/53 feature tests plus syntax checks for every changed JavaScript file. GitHub workflow run `36444662308` passed the full retained regression suite, dedicated v01/v02/v03 generator checks, Owner/privacy/Hidden protections, generated SEO, release packaging and Development Pages deployment. Package-validation commit Pages run `36444727257` also completed successfully.

Validation limitation: interactive desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing was not available. The reported browser symptom identified the race, but the v03 fix itself is validated by repository tests/static startup-path inspection rather than a real browser session; user confirmation in Development is still required for that interactive behavior.

### Development `2026-09-29-v02`

Previous Development: `2026-09-29-v01`

Purpose: preserve the exact inventory/list position while generating owner posts by opening card post generators in a separate tab/window.

Changes:
- Generate FB Post, Generate Carousell Post and Generate eBay Post now open their existing generator route in a new browser tab/window instead of replacing the inventory tab.
- The original inventory page is left untouched, preserving its exact filters, list state and scroll position.
- The selected card ID is still passed to each generator and preselection behavior from v01 is retained.
- Restores the intended secure same-origin Owner Mode handoff already supported by startup/auth: only a random nonce is placed in the URL; the authenticated Supabase session is handed to the new tab through same-origin postMessage/BroadcastChannel, with normal persisted-session lookup as fallback.
- If the browser blocks the new tab/window, the owner receives an allow-pop-ups message instead of losing the current inventory position.
- Public users gain no owner generator access.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully after reconciling one retained v01 test assertion that still required the intentionally removed same-tab navigation. Changed JavaScript syntax, imports/cache references, full feature regression tests, retained v01 generator behavior, dedicated v02 new-tab/card-selection/secure-handoff checks, Owner/Hidden/privacy protections, generated SEO, release packaging/integrity and Development GitHub Pages deployment all passed.

### Development `2026-09-29-v01`

Previous Development: `2026-09-28-v07`

Purpose: add direct Carousell and eBay generator shortcuts beside the existing Facebook shortcut in each owner card quick-action menu.

Changes:
- Adds `Generate Carousell Post` and `Generate eBay Post` to the card-preview owner `⋯` menu beside `Generate FB Post`.
- Each shortcut carries the selected card ID into the existing Post Generator Tools route.
- Carousell and eBay generators now preselect the requested card when that card is valid for the generator's existing listing scope.
- Existing generator eligibility is preserved: Carousell continues excluding archived cards and eBay continues using live listings only.
- Browser Back retains the existing listing return/scroll behavior.
- Public users gain no generator or owner-menu access.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. Changed JavaScript syntax, imports/assets/cache references, dedicated FB/Carousell/eBay quick-action routing and card-ID preselection checks, existing post-generator behavior, Owner/Hidden/privacy protections, generated SEO, retained Development regressions, package creation/integrity and Development GitHub Pages deployment all passed.

### Development `2026-09-28-v07`

Previous Development: `2026-09-28-v06`

Purpose: strengthen eBay Listing Generator descriptions with clear, buyer-friendly condition disclosures to reduce ambiguity and future condition disputes.

Changes:
- Adds a universal statement that only the cards/items shown and described are included.
- States that listing photos form part of the item description/condition assessment and that minor imperfections may not be fully captured because of lighting, reflections, camera angle or display differences.
- Raw listings state that condition is subjective and does not guarantee a PSA/BGS/CGC/other grading result.
- Graded listings state that the shown grade is assigned by the stated grading company and that the holder/slab may have minor handling marks that do not affect the assigned grade.
- Sealed listings state that outer packaging may have minor wear, dents, scratches, loose wrapping or other imperfections.
- Invites buyers to request additional information/close-up photos before purchase when condition is important.
- Adds a reminder to verify the delivery address before purchase.
- Retains the v06 14-row Description editor and all existing eBay title, item-specific, copy, image ZIP, card selection and Owner Mode behavior.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. Feature tests exercised raw, PSA-graded and sealed generated descriptions and verified format-specific disclosures; changed JavaScript syntax, repository/import/asset references, retained post-generator behavior, v05/v06 regressions, Owner/Hidden/privacy protections, generated SEO, package creation/integrity and Development GitHub Pages build/deployment all passed.

### Development `2026-09-28-v06`

Previous Development: `2026-09-28-v05`

Purpose: enlarge the eBay Listing Generator Description editor so the generated description is easier to review and copy.

Changes:
- The eBay Description textarea now opens at 14 text rows instead of the browser's small default height.
- Item Specifics remains at 8 rows.
- The existing vertical textarea resize behavior is preserved.
- No eBay title, item-specific, description-generation, copy, image ZIP, card selection, Owner Mode or database behavior changed.

### Development `2026-09-28-v05`

Previous Development: `2026-09-28-v04`

Purpose: expose the existing seven-day `new` inventory quick filter as a visible **Newly Added** pill immediately beside Trending.

Changes:
- Added a `Newly Added` quick-filter pill directly after `Trending`.
- Reuses the existing `quick=new` route/filter behavior and existing `isNewCard(card, 7)` definition.
- Newly Added therefore shows live listings created within the last 7 days and composes with the existing inventory filters/search behavior.
- No database fields, SQL, styling system or unrelated inventory behavior changed.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. Feature regression tests passed 48/48; changed JavaScript syntax, repository references, imports/assets, inventory/filter behavior, retained Hidden/private-route SEO protections, dedicated Newly Added pill/order/URL behavior, release package integrity and Development GitHub Pages deployment all passed.

### Development `2026-09-28-v04`

Previous Development: `2026-09-28-v03`

Purpose: generate clean name-based card routes for owner-only Hidden/Draft and Archived listings without turning those listings into public SEO content.

Changes:
- Public/live listings keep the existing full SEO page generation, public `seo-slugs.json` map and sitemap behavior.
- Added a minimal `get_private_card_routes()` Supabase RPC that returns only card ID + clean route slug for Draft/Archived or legacy Hidden/Archived listings. It does not return card details, prices, images, notes or grading JSON.
- The generator creates a generic static route shell for each private listing so an authenticated owner can refresh/open its clean `/cards/<slug>/` URL.
- Private route shells contain only the card ID needed for Owner Mode routing, use `noindex,nofollow,noarchive`, contain no card metadata/JSON-LD/Open Graph card data, and are excluded from the sitemap.
- Private slugs are stored separately in `owner-card-routes.json`; normal visitors continue loading only the public SEO slug map.
- Owner Mode lazily loads the private route map when opening a non-live card. Buyer Preview/public users do not gain Hidden/Archived card access; existing RLS and router guards remain authoritative.

SQL required: Yes — `migrations/2026/2026-09-28-v04-PRIVATE-CARD-ROUTES.sql`. Rerunnable. User confirmed it was applied to Supabase on 2026-09-28.

Validation status: completed successfully after the SQL application was confirmed and the previously failed SEO workflow was rerun. Feature regression tests, SEO generator syntax/self-test, JavaScript/repository references, buyer/privacy/Hidden Listings guards, the dedicated Development v04 Hidden/Archived clean-route checks, generated SEO files, retained v27/v28/v01/v02/v03 behavior, QR inventory CTA watermark, global Bulk Images, game-aware new-card ordering, package creation/integrity and Development GitHub Pages deployment all passed. An actual generated private route was also inspected: it contains the owner-routing card ID and `noindex,nofollow,noarchive`, contains no JSON-LD/Open Graph card metadata, and its slug is absent from both `sitemap.xml` and public `seo-slugs.json`.

### Development `2026-09-28-v03`

Previous Development: `2026-09-28-v02`

Purpose: preserve deliberately saved USD/SGD listing prices when reopening Add/Edit forms while retaining MYR-driven automatic conversion when the owner requests it.

Changes:
- Existing saved USD and SGD values are treated as manual when Add/Edit/Clone currency wiring initializes, so loading the current FX rate does not overwrite them.
- Changing MYR still clears the manual state and recalculates both USD and SGD using the current loaded rate.
- Pressing `Refresh rate` still explicitly recalculates both converted currencies.
- Save behavior is unchanged: existing non-empty USD/SGD values are preserved.
- No Inventory ordering, Sold ordering, Owner authorization, analytics, Contact to Buy, generators, giveaways or database behavior changes.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully after correcting two validation-harness issues: the new FX regression test initially omitted the app's rounding constants, and the repository checker retained the pre-promotion Production baseline marker. The application preservation fix itself did not fail. Final feature regression tests passed 46/46, including saved manual USD/SGD preservation and MYR-change reconversion. JavaScript syntax, imports/references, retained routing/analytics/privacy/Hidden Listings/generator behavior, v27/v28/v01/v02 checks, SEO generation, package integrity and Development Pages deployment all passed.

Validation limitation: interactive desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing was not performed; the behavior was exercised through the executable feature regression test and repository validation.

### Development `2026-09-28-v02`

Previous Development: `2026-09-28-v01`

Purpose: make the public Sold page and Buyer Preview use the same true sold-date ordering as Owner Mode.

Changes:
- Added a privacy-safe public Sold-order RPC that exposes only live Sold listing IDs and their chronological rank, not the private `sold_at` timestamp.
- Public catalogue loading hydrates that Sold rank when Sold listings are present.
- `Recently Sold` prefers the public Sold rank for buyers and retains `sold_at` sorting for Owner Mode, with existing timestamp fallbacks preserved.
- Buyer/public ordering therefore follows the same sold chronology as Owner Mode after the migration is applied.
- No Inventory/Collection custom ordering, Owner Mode controls, analytics, Contact to Buy, generators or giveaway behavior changes.

SQL required: Yes — `migrations/2026/2026-09-28-v02-PUBLIC-SOLD-ORDER.sql`. Rerunnable. User confirmed it was applied to Supabase on 2026-09-28.

Validation status: completed successfully. Feature regression tests passed 45/45, including buyer Sold-rank ordering and Owner `sold_at` ordering. Changed JavaScript syntax, imports/cache references, privacy-safe RPC contract, retained v27/v28/v01 behavior, buyer/privacy/hidden-card guards, SEO generation, release ZIP integrity and Development GitHub Pages deployment all passed.

Validation limitations:
- SQL application is user-confirmed; the live public RPC response and rendered Buyer Preview ordering have not yet been independently exercised after application.
- Interactive desktop/mobile/Safari browser testing was not available.

### Development `2026-09-28-v01`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v28`

Purpose: restore the Owner Mode `...` quick-action menu to the expected top-right corner on desktop Sold/Reserved card previews.

Changes:
- Desktop Owner Mode Sold/Reserved cards keep the shared quick-action menu at the standard top-right position.
- The grade/condition overlay moves below the owner menu only for authenticated desktop Owner Mode, preventing overlap.
- Public Sold/Reserved card presentation remains unchanged.
- Mobile Owner Mode remains disabled by the existing security guard.
- No card data, Supabase schema, analytics, Contact to Buy, generators or giveaway behavior changes.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully after aligning two stale stylesheet-cache assertions in the workflow. Feature regression tests passed 43/43, JavaScript/repository/import checks passed, the Sold/Reserved Owner Mode menu placement guard passed, retained v27/v28 behavior passed, SEO generation passed, release ZIP integrity passed, and Development GitHub Pages deployment succeeded.

### Development `2026-09-27-v28`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v27`

Purpose: correct new Inventory-card automatic placement so the saved game/category is respected before grade/condition/format ordering.

Changes:
- Newly added Inventory cards are inserted inside their own exact `game` category instead of using one global slab/raw/sealed bucket across all games.
- Within that game/category, new-card placement is: Graded first (highest numeric grade first), then Raw M → NM → LP → MP → HP → DMG → N/A, then Sealed.
- Existing cards retain their relative custom order; this change does not globally rearrange existing Inventory cards.
- A brand-new game/category uses the saved Inventory game-group order where available.
- The One Piece Hyper Battle / One Piece Card Game distinction is therefore preserved during new-card insertion.
- No database schema change or SQL migration is required.

Validation status: completed successfully. Feature regression tests, changed JavaScript syntax, import/cache references, game-aware new-card insertion tests, Inventory filter/game-browser regression checks, Owner/privacy/hidden-card guards, retained v27 Bulk Images, SEO generation, release ZIP creation/integrity and Development Pages deployment all passed.

### Development `2026-09-27-v27`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v26`

Purpose: make the Bulk Edit image workflow explicitly global across the complete inventory.

Changes:
- `Inventory Tools → Bulk Edit → Bulk Images` is now labeled `Bulk Images — All Listings`.
- The page states that one action applies to every photo in every inventory listing and no listing selection is required.
- Removes the older per-listing checkbox/Select All reprocess UI from the Bulk Edit image page to avoid implying that listings must be selected.
- The selective high-quality reprocess tool remains available under `Inventory Tools → Quality`.
- Global Original / Logo + CTA + QR / CTA + QR-only behavior remains owner-only and continues to iterate every loaded listing with images.
- Production is unchanged.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. Repository-wide JavaScript/reference checks, feature regressions, Owner/privacy/hidden-listing guards, existing QR watermark behavior, v27 global Bulk Images assertions, package integrity and Development Pages deployment passed.

### Development `2026-09-27-v26`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v25`

Purpose: add an owner-only Bulk Edit image workflow for applying one reversible image style across every inventory photo without opening cards individually.

Changes:
- Adds `Inventory Tools → Bulk Edit → Bulk Images`.
- Adds global actions for `Logo + CTA + QR · All Photos`, `CTA + QR only · All Photos`, and `Use Originals · All Photos`.
- CTA + QR only is regenerated from each saved clean original; it never renders on top of an already-watermarked public image.
- Full and website-only bulk watermark changes regenerate the requested style from the clean original so switching styles cannot accidentally reuse the wrong previous watermark.
- Superseded owned watermark files are removed only after reversible metadata and public card image URLs save successfully.
- Clean originals remain preserved and reversible.
- Existing per-card Add/Edit all-photo controls remain unchanged.
- Owner Mode is required; public users receive no bulk image controls.
- Production is unchanged.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: completed successfully. Feature regression tests, JavaScript syntax/repository references, owner/privacy guards, hidden-listing and inventory regressions, QR inventory CTA watermark checks, Development v26 bulk-image checks, SEO generation, full/patch ZIP integrity and Development GitHub Pages deployment passed.

### Development `2026-09-27-v25`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v24`

Purpose: make the Add/Edit owner editor more compact and restore the single continuous photos + details workflow requested after reviewing v24.

Changes:
- Removes the v24 Photos / Card Details tabs and restores one continuous Add/Edit scroll flow.
- Photos remain first; card details follow immediately below.
- Reduces the large-desktop editor to a maximum 1100px width with tighter padding.
- Keeps readable v24 typography but slightly reduces section, label, hint and action sizing for a denser layout.
- Uses 3 photo columns on large desktop, 2 on medium screens, and 1 on mobile.
- Reduces the large-desktop photo stage from 380/430px behavior to a compact 350px stage while preserving full-image `object-fit: contain` behavior.
- Retains section headings and sticky Save / Cancel controls.
- Restores standard native form validation because no required fields are hidden behind tabs.
- Preserves watermark generation, PSA privacy controls, image ordering/storage, Supabase/RLS, Owner Mode and public inventory behavior.
- Production is unchanged.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: in progress. Automated validation, package integrity, Development deployment, and responsive visual confirmation are required before acceptance.

### Development `2026-09-27-v24`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v23`

Purpose: make the Add/Edit owner workspace easier to read and navigate responsively without changing card or image behavior.

Changes:
- Adds responsive `Photos` and `Card Details` editor tabs shared by Add and Edit.
- Keeps the photo workspace wide and uses 3 columns on large desktop, 2 on tablet/smaller desktop, and 1 on mobile.
- Moves the card fields into clearly labelled Basic information, Listing, Pricing, Grading, and Notes & owner information sections.
- Increases field labels, input/select text, hints, watermark status and photo-control typography for readability.
- Keeps bulk photo controls at the top of the Photos workspace.
- Adds a sticky Cancel / Save action bar.
- If validation fails while Photos is selected, the editor switches to Card Details before reporting/focusing the invalid field.
- Preserves v23 full-image previews, controls-below-image behavior, watermark generation, PSA privacy controls, image ordering/storage, Supabase/RLS, Owner Mode and public inventory behavior.
- Production is unchanged.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: in progress. Automated validation, package integrity, Development deployment, and desktop/mobile responsive visual confirmation are required before acceptance.

### Development `2026-09-27-v23`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v22`

Purpose: turn Add/Edit into a wider owner workspace so large multi-photo listings are easier to inspect and manage.

Changes:
- Expands the desktop Edit modal to a maximum 1180px workspace and the Add form to the same maximum width.
- Uses three photo columns on large desktop, two on medium screens, and retains the existing narrow/mobile behavior.
- Keeps each photo fully visible with controls below the preview.
- Keeps non-photo form content centered at a readable maximum width instead of stretching every field across the workspace.
- Does not change Add/Edit data handling, image ordering/storage, watermark generation, PSA masking, Supabase/RLS, public inventory behavior or Production.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: in progress. Desktop browser/screenshot confirmation of the wider Add/Edit workspace is required before acceptance.

### Development `2026-09-27-v22`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v21`

Purpose: align Add/Edit photo preview heights while keeping every source image fully visible.

Changes:
- Gives each desktop Add/Edit photo a consistent 430px preview stage so left/right controls align even when source aspect ratios differ.
- Keeps `object-fit: contain`, so no part of a source image is cropped.
- Uses responsive equal-height stages on mobile while preserving the v21 controls-below-image layout.
- Does not change watermark generation, PSA masking behavior, image ordering/storage, public inventory images or Production.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: in progress. Screenshot/browser confirmation of equal-height preview rows is required before acceptance.

### Development `2026-09-27-v21`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v20`

Purpose: keep Add/Edit photo previews fully visible while retaining all owner watermark, PSA privacy and rotation controls.

Changes:
- Moves the per-photo Logo/CTA/QR, Original, Hide PSA info, Undo hide and rotation controls below the photo instead of overlaying the lower half.
- Lets each Add/Edit preview render at its natural full image aspect ratio.
- Keeps drag handle, photo number and remove control accessible at the top of the preview.
- Does not change watermark generation, PSA masking behavior, image ordering/storage, public inventory images or Production.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: in progress. Desktop visual confirmation of the unobstructed Edit-card preview is required before this release is accepted.

### Development `2026-09-27-v20`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v19`

Purpose: reduce the approved inventory watermark banner size after visual review on a portrait listing photo.

Changes:
- Scales the existing approved watermark banner to 82% of the source image width instead of nearly full width.
- Keeps the banner centered and bottom-aligned.
- Preserves the exact approved artwork, aspect ratio and dynamic QR behavior from v19.
- No other visual, Inventory, Owner Mode, Supabase/RLS, Contact to Buy, giveaway, analytics, navigation or Production behavior is intentionally changed.

SQL required: No.

Validation status: in progress. Desktop visual confirmation of the new 82% size is required before this release is accepted.

### Development `2026-09-27-v19`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v17`

Purpose: integrate the user-confirmed approved inventory watermark banner as the canonical artwork after the rejected v18 asset experiment was rolled back.

Changes:
- Uses `dev/assets/collect-tcg-inventory-watermark-approved.png` as the complete 1113×242 banner artwork.
- The approved artwork is rendered as one intact layer; browser fonts no longer recreate the banner.
- Only the QR interior is regenerated dynamically, preserving the approved QR surround while keeping the inventory destination functional.
- Preserves the existing optional top-right logo path and owner-only watermark controls.
- No Supabase/RLS, Inventory data/order/filtering, Contact to Buy, giveaway, analytics, navigation or Production behavior is intentionally changed.

SQL required: No.

Validation:
- Feature regression suite: 43/43 passed.
- Changed JavaScript syntax checks: passed.
- Approved banner asset identity/path, 1113×242 artwork integration and dynamic QR wiring: passed.
- Complete routing/initialize/register-features/main/index cache chain: passed.

### Development `2026-09-27-v17`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v10`

Purpose: rebuild the inventory CTA watermark from the clean v10 baseline to match the user-approved visual reference without reusing the abandoned v11-v16 watermark redesign implementations.

Changes:
- Keeps the existing v10 watermark modes and QR destination.
- Rebuilds only the bottom inventory CTA banner with the reference's near-edge-to-edge ~4.67:1 proportions.
- Uses a black/gold double frame and glow, left Collect TCG branding treatment, centered `CHECK PRICE • AVAILABILITY` CTA, outlined URL pill, right-side QR card and decorative gold slashes.
- Keeps the optional top-right logo behavior from v10 unchanged.
- No Supabase/RLS, public navigation, Inventory ordering/filtering, Contact to Buy, giveaway or analytics behavior is intentionally changed.
- Development v11-v16 watermark redesign attempts were rolled back and remain abandoned; do not restore them as active behavior.

SQL required: No.

### Development `2026-09-27-v10`

Previous Development: `2026-09-27-v09`

Purpose: improve generated card-image website watermarks so social images actively drive buyers to browse more inventory.

Changes:
- Website watermark banner now says `SEE MORE CARDS • BROWSE INVENTORY`.
- Adds a real QR code pointing to the Production Inventory URL already defined by `CARD_WATERMARK_URL`.
- Keeps the visible short site address `collecttcg.github.io/Collect_TCG`.
- Owner image controls now describe the choices as `Logo + CTA + QR` and `CTA + QR only`.
- Existing logo watermark remains optional; the CTA + QR-only option provides the cleaner no-top-logo layout.
- No Supabase/RLS or public navigation behavior changes.

Validation:
- regression suite passed: 43/43
- changed JavaScript syntax checks passed
- QR inventory CTA/wiring/owner-label checks passed
- repository, Owner/privacy, Inventory/generator and SEO checks passed
- full/patch ZIP integrity passed
- GitHub Pages deployment passed

### Development `2026-09-27-v09`

Purpose: add a Development-only analytics test exclusion for ChatGPT/GitHub/OpenAI/automation UI checks so Dev can be exercised without contaminating buyer Insights. The explicit `analytics_test` query flag is honored only on `collecttcg.github.io/Collect_TCG_Dev/`, grants no Owner permissions, and does not change Production.

### Development `2026-09-27-v08`

Purpose: complete the Beta → Development environment migration. The active application directory is renamed from `beta/` to canonical `dev/`; active build, serve, validation, tests, SEO generation and workflow references use `dev/`; GitHub Pages publishes the contents of `dev/` as the site root at `https://collecttcg.github.io/Collect_TCG_Dev/`. No application feature behavior or Production code is intentionally changed.

The validated functional baseline carried forward from the former Beta environment includes:
- v16 clone flow fix: clone drafts remain available while the Add clone route rerenders, and are cleared on cancel/success/normal Add as appropriate.
- v18 Inventory behavior: default remains **Custom Order**; only newly added Inventory cards are inserted automatically into the current custom order using the slab/raw-condition/sealed grouping rule without reordering existing cards.
- v19 repository cleanup and structure normalization.
- Existing SEO/discovery/Owner analytics/privacy behavior and retained generators/tools.

### Beta `2026-09-26-v19`

Purpose: repository cleanup and migration-history organization.

v19 changes retained by v20:
- All historical SQL centralized under `migrations/` without changing migration filenames or SQL content.
- Date-versioned migrations live under `migrations/2026/`.
- Legacy `V###` migration history lives under `migrations/legacy/`.
- Added `migrations/README.md` documenting migration rules.
- Removed confirmed dead/stale files and V93-era documentation.
- Updated active engineering docs/package metadata.
- Added repository-structure validation so misplaced SQL, missing migration history, returned retired files, and missing documented CSS are detected.
- Owner QR Generator was confirmed to remain active through the Owner Tools flow in `bulk-status.js`.
- Owner Insights was confirmed to dynamically load `src/styles/27-insights-dashboard.css`.
- No database migration was newly required or reapplied by the cleanup.

### Beta `2026-09-26-v18`

Purpose: preserve manual custom ordering while placing only newly added cards automatically.

Inventory behavior:
- Default Inventory sort remains `Custom Order`.
- Existing cards are not automatically rearranged.
- A newly added Inventory card is inserted into the existing custom order using:
  - Graded slabs first
  - Mint
  - Near Mint
  - Lightly Played
  - Moderately Played
  - Heavily Played
  - Damaged
  - N/A
  - Sealed last
- Existing cards retain their relative order.
- Collection/NFS custom ordering is not changed by this insertion behavior.

### Production `2026-09-27-v01`

Previous Production: `2026-09-26-v08`

Beta promoted from: none — Production-only cleanup; functional baseline remains Beta `2026-09-26-v16`

Purpose: clean and normalize the Production repository without promoting newer Beta application behavior.

Production 2026-09-27-v01 includes:
- the existing Production v08/Beta v16 functional baseline, including clone draft persistence/cleanup;
- Production SQL migration history moved under `migrations/2026/` without changing SQL contents;
- obsolete `PRODUCTION-DEPLOY.txt` removed;
- canonical Owner QR Generator module registered so the retained QR route works;
- Production Insights SQL help text corrected to Production migration filenames/paths;
- Production repository-structure validation added;
- Production SEO regenerated and validated independently.

Production 2026-09-27-v01 still does **not** contain Beta v18 new-card custom-order insertion behavior.

## Current Development Repository Structure

The active Development structure is:

- `dev/` — canonical deployable Development website
- `dev/src/` — active application modules/styles
- `dev/assets/` — active local runtime image assets
- `dev/cards/` — generated SEO card pages
- `migrations/2026/` — date-versioned Supabase SQL migration history
- `migrations/legacy/` — retained legacy `V###` SQL migration history
- `tests/` — regression tests
- `tools/` — validation/build/local preview/SEO tooling
- `docs/` — current engineering documentation
- `insights/` — standalone Owner-only Insights Development PWA
- `release-manifests/` — release package/checksum records
- `COLLECT_TCG_BASELINE.md` — current project baseline/source of truth

Generated SEO files such as `dev/cards/**/index.html`, `dev/seo-slugs.json`, `dev/sitemap.xml`, and `dev/robots.txt` are intentional and must not be treated as repository clutter.

---

---

## SQL / Database Baseline

All Development-era SQL migration history is centralized under `migrations/`; historical Beta filenames remain unchanged.

Current migration files:

### Date-versioned migrations
- `migrations/2026/2026-09-15-v10-LANGUAGE-DETAILS.sql`
- `migrations/2026/2026-09-15-v13-EXTEND-LANGUAGE-OPTIONS.sql`
- `migrations/2026/2026-09-17-v18-COUNTRY-CARD-DEMAND.sql`
- `migrations/2026/2026-09-24-v01-SEO-PUBLIC-CATALOG.sql`
- `migrations/2026/2026-09-24-v07-DISCOVERY-ATTRIBUTION.sql`
- `migrations/2026/2026-09-24-v08-DISCOVERY-SUMMARY.sql`
- `migrations/2026/2026-09-26-v10-PUBLIC-HIDDEN-LISTING-GUARD.sql`

### Legacy migration
- `migrations/legacy/V208-GIVEAWAY-FACEBOOK-GROUP-BONUS.sql`

The v19 repository cleanup moved these files only. It did not modify SQL contents and did not reapply migrations.

Do not infer that a migration has been applied merely because it exists in the repository. For future DB changes, explicitly record whether the migration was actually applied.

Preserve Supabase/RLS behavior and backward compatibility where practical. Do not change RLS unless required by the requested feature.

---

## Intentionally Removed / Excluded Features

Do not restore these unless explicitly requested:

- Download Share Preview
- V200 multi-card inquiry basket
- V201 custom Share menu/grid
- V202 share-menu experiment
- V203/V204 compact-layout experiments

Do not reintroduce abandoned/experimental work simply because it appears in old commits or packages.

---

## v19 Repository Cleanup — Intentionally Removed Files

These files were removed because they were confirmed stale/dead and should not silently return:

- `dev/src/app/beta-config.js`
- `dev/src/features/content/retention.js`
- `dev/src/styles/beta.css`
- `dev/assets/one-piece-card-game-logo.png` — unused local asset; active One Piece game-browser source is elsewhere
- `dev/README.md` — redundant with the current root README
- `docs/SANDBOX.md` — obsolete V93 isolation/sandbox instructions
- `docs/package-checksums.json` — obsolete V93 package snapshot

The validation tool checks for these retired files so accidental restoration is caught.

---

## Files That May Look Old but Are Still Active

Do not delete files solely because their filenames contain older version numbers.

Examples:
- compatibility and UI stylesheet layers under `dev/src/styles/01-29`
- `docs/function-map.json` — used by regression tests as the original modularization fixture
- `dev/src/styles/27-insights-dashboard.css` — dynamically loaded by Owner Insights
- generated SEO card pages
- release manifests
- historical SQL migrations

Canonical active JavaScript modules must not be replaced by version-suffixed active module filenames.

---

## Production Safety

Do not browse/open the live Production website for testing unless explicitly authorized because it may contaminate Insights.

Prefer:
- repository inspection
- static/local validation
- Development testing
- GitHub Actions/Pages deployment status
- screenshots provided by the user

Production must not be modified, promoted, deployed, or prepared unless the user explicitly requests a Production update.

---

## Validation Baseline

A commit alone does not complete a release.

Before reporting a Development or Production release completed:
- run syntax checks on every changed JS file
- validate changed relative imports and targets
- validate changed HTML/assets and IDs/classes
- exercise the requested feature where tools allow
- inspect likely regressions around affected functionality
- preserve Owner Mode/public access boundaries
- identify SQL requirements and application status
- inspect the release diff for unintended files/debug code
- inspect committed files after commit
- confirm package creation and checksums
- distinguish browser/visual testing from static inspection

Current Development validation also checks:
- SQL files remain under `migrations/`
- required migration history remains present
- retired v19 files do not return
- documented stylesheets exist
- retained QR Generator wiring remains present
- Owner Insights dashboard stylesheet wiring remains present
- public hidden/draft guards remain present

If validation is incomplete, report: `Implemented, validation pending.`

---

## Package Expectations

For every completed Development update provide:
- Full Development ZIP
- Previous → new Development patch ZIP
- SQL migration separately when required
- Change summary
- Changed-file summary
- Validation summary

For every completed Production update provide:
- Full Production ZIP
- Previous → new Production patch ZIP
- SQL migration separately when required
- Previous Production version
- Development version promoted from
- Validation summary

Current package records before v20 packaging:

Beta `2026-09-26-v19`:
- `Collect-TCG-Beta-2026-09-26-v19-full.zip`
- `Collect-TCG-Beta-2026-09-26-v18-to-2026-09-26-v19-patch.zip`

Production `2026-09-26-v08`:
- `Collect-TCG-Production-2026-09-26-v08-full.zip`
- `Collect-TCG-Production-2026-09-26-v07-to-2026-09-26-v08-patch.zip`

Beta 2026-09-27-v01 packages must be:
- `Collect-TCG-Beta-2026-09-27-v01-full.zip`
- `Collect-TCG-Beta-2026-09-26-v20-to-2026-09-27-v01-patch.zip`

---

## Version Naming Rules

### Development full package

`Collect-TCG-Dev-YYYY-MM-DD-vNN-full.zip`

### Development patch

`Collect-TCG-Dev-OLDVERSION-to-NEWVERSION-patch.zip`

### Production full package

`Collect-TCG-Production-YYYY-MM-DD-vNN-full.zip`

### Production patch

`Collect-TCG-Production-OLDVERSION-to-NEWVERSION-patch.zip`

### SQL migration

`YYYY-MM-DD-vNN-DESCRIPTIVE-NAME.sql`

Historical migration filenames are immutable even when files are organized into migration directories.

---

## Production Promotion Rule

When a Development version is approved for Production:

- identify the latest Production baseline
- identify the approved Development version
- confirm Development validation status
- determine exactly which approved Development changes are not yet in Production
- promote only approved Development changes
- do not include abandoned or experimental Development work
- do not silently promote Development with unresolved regressions caused by that Development release
- record the previous Production version
- record which Development version was promoted
- create a new date-based Production version using Production's independent daily counter
- validate Production independently after promotion
- create and verify the Production full and patch packages

Current Beta-only application behavior relative to Production 2026-09-27-v01 includes the v18 new-card custom-order insertion behavior. Beta repository-structure/documentation releases remain separate from Production application promotion. Do not assume all Beta-only structural changes should be promoted without reviewing Production-specific paths and retained behavior.

---

## Update This File After Releases

After every accepted Development or Production release, update at minimum:
- reconciliation date
- Latest Development
- Previous Development
- Latest Production
- Previous Production 
- Development version promoted from, for Production
- important release purpose / retained behavior
- SQL status where relevant
- validation/deployment status
- package names
- important Development-only changes still pending Production promotion

This file is the source of truth for the current Development/Production baseline and intentionally removed/retained features. Repository inspection still takes precedence when determining the actual latest code before making a new change.
